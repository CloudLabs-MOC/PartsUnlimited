## Overview

In this lab we will Create a new Azure DevOps project and populate the project repository with our application code, then we will crate a new build pipeline, install **WhiteSource Bolt** from the **Azure DevOps Marketplace** to make it available as a task and activate it. Finally then we will add **WhiteSource Bolt** as one of our build tasks and scan our project code for security vulnerabilities and licensing compliance issues and view the resultant report.

Then, click the **Add** button three times next to the Gradle task to add three Gradle tasks to the build pipeline. Gradle will be used to build the Integration Service, Order Service, and Clients components of the MRP app.

    ![Screenshot of the Add tasks build task options with Gradle highlighted](../assets/feb2019-secandcompliancewhitesource/secandcomp10.png) 


6.  Select the first Gradle task and set the below values, leaving any items not mentioned as their default values.

    - Display name: **IntegrationService**
    - gradle wrapper: **src/Backend/IntegrationService/gradlew** (either type or browse using the **...** button)
    - Working Directory: **src/Backend/IntegrationService** (either type or browse using the **...** button)
    - JUnit Test Results: **uncheck** the checkbox to **Publish to Azure Pipelines/TFS**, since we will not be running automated tests in the Integration Service. 

    ![Screenshot of the first gradle task with the field values mentioned configured and highlighted](../assets/feb2019-secandcompliancewhitesource/secandcomp11.png) 


7. Select the first Gradle task and set the below values, leaving any items not mentioned as their default values.
